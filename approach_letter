Dear X,

Good morning! I hope this e-mail finds you well. My name is Reginaldo Junior, Iâ€™m Deputy Head of Controlling at Banco do Brasil.
My reason to write this message is because I would like to meet you to learn more about Pioneers.

Given my position, I am often looking for Banking Trends and Digital Solutions for new sources of efficiency and/or revenues. It only happens that, in this process, I have started paying more attention at the so called Fintech movement. By mapping the "scene" here in Vienna, the name Pioneers poped up in my screen and I found your work extremelly interesting.

For a career, I am originally from marketing, but have turned into banking following my numerical skills and abstract thinking inclination. Yet, have experienced lately a growing frustration due to the gap between what I see "happening out there in the  world" and the environment I find myself in.

Could we schedule a phone call or perhaps a coffee meeting in the next few weeks? I have looked about you through the website, but I found it is always better if there is a possibility of meeting face to face. I understand your network and expertise in the innovation industry can be incredibly valuable. From my side, I can offer you some insights on how a small international bank is dealing with change. I guess it can be an interesting conversation.

Make myself available and look forward to meeting you.
