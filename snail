Sub snail()
'A snail sits in front of a 4.5m high wall.
'Every day she will climb 50cm upwards and every night she slips back 10% of her height reached so far.
'How many days will she have to climb to reach the top of the wall.

'For that, I set up the following algo:
'Variables
'   - day is defined to start at 0 and count the days that have passed
'   - pDay takes the last position at night (pNight) and increments by 0.5
'   - pNight takes the position at the end of the day (pDay) and reduces by 10%

'Since the snail goes up more than it goes down, it should reach the top of the 4.5 wall
'while going up, so we set the doWhile limit on the pDay variable
'At the end of the sub it pops up a message with the final position and number of days passed

Dim day As Integer
Dim pDay As Double
Dim pNight As Double
